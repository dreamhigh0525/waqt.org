             /_/  a muslim prayertimes calculator (http://waqt.org) 

this is the sourcecode to waqt.org, a muslim prayertimes calculation website.  it relies on open source tools and apis to do it's calculations.

dependencies:
- itl php extension - http://svn.arabeyes.org/viewvc/projects/itl/ports/php/
- yahoo geocoding api - http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/rest/V1/geocode.html
- geonames api - http://www.geonames.org/

requirements:
- setup and install libitl, which can be found at arabeyes.org or on sourceforge https://sourceforge.net/projects/arabeyes/files/ITL.
- setup and install the php extension (phpize, configure, make, make install).
- make a settings.inc file.  the contents of this file should be:
  <?php
  $appid = '';  // put your yahoo app id here
  $gaCode = ''; // put your google analytics code here

  define('GA_CODE', $gaCode);
  define('YAHOO_APPID', $appid);
  define('USERNAME', 'geonames_username');

  * note - the username parameter was added to geonames to prevent abuse
    of their webservice.  you can make one for free on the geonames site,
    or comment out the json part of prayertimes.inc and uncomment the xml
    part.  for more information, please see:
    http://geonames.wordpress.com/2010/03/16/ddos-part-ii/

- for apache, you need to use the .htaccess file for cleaner links
- for lighttpd, something like this under the host should work:
  url.rewrite = ( "^/rss(.*)" => "/index.php$1&rss=1", 
                  "^/about(.*)" => "/index.php?about=1" )

i am providing this code to help those muslims who want to put prayertimes on their websites.
