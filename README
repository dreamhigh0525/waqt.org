             /_/  a muslim prayertimes calculator (http://waqt.org) 

this is the sourcecode to waqt.org, a muslim prayertimes calculation website.  it relies on open source tools and apis to do it's calculations.

dependencies:
- itl php extension - http://svn.arabeyes.org/viewvc/projects/itl/ports/php/
- yahoo geocoding api - http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/rest/V1/geocode.html
- geonames api - http://www.geonames.org/

requirements:
- setup and install libitl, which can be found at arabeyes.org or on sourceforge https://sourceforge.net/projects/arabeyes/files/ITL.
- setup and install the php extension (phpize, configure, make, make install).
- make a settings.inc file.  the contents of this file should be:
  <?php
  $appid = '';  // put your yahoo app id here

- for apache, you need to use the .htaccess file for cleaner links
- for lighttpd, something like this under the host should work:
  url.rewrite = ( "^/rss(.*)" => "/index.php$1&rss=1", 
                  "^/about(.*)" => "/index.php?about=1" )

i am providing this code to help those muslims who want to put prayertimes on their websites.
